## FitnessTrack


### Description 

FitnessTrack is a web app intended to make tracking meals/nutrition, workouts, and weight much easier, and allow you to set personalized goals. I started this project when I was going through a health kick and wanted to make sure I was putting on some decent muscle weight while still eating the right balance of food. 

I found myself using spreadsheets to track everything because other solutions were expensive and/or didn't have quite what I needed. The spreadsheets were effective but tedious, and I'm a spreadsheet person! I recognize that many people are not, so I hope this may be useful to a few people trying to make positive changes in their lives by taking control of their health and being able see their progress tracked and compared to their goals.
